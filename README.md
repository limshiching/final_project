# SUGAR COMBAT #

Created Sugar Combat as our final project at Next Academy.

The app is built around the idea that users are able to snap a picture of their daily meals and upload it onto the app, and derive its nutritional value in order to maintain a healthy lifestlye.

We used Clarifai to identify the different types of food in our pictures, and from identification, we send the food name to Nutritionix database to get its nutritional values.
